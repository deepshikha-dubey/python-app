Explanation of the CI Pipeline
1. Workflow Name
yaml
name: CI Pipeline
This is just a label for your workflow.

It will appear in the GitHub Actions tab as “CI Pipeline”.

2. Triggers (When It Runs)
yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]
push → Runs whenever you push code to the main branch.

pull_request → Runs whenever someone opens a pull request targeting the main branch.

This ensures your pipeline checks code before merging into the main branch.

3. Jobs Section
yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
jobs → Defines tasks the workflow will perform.

build → Name of the job.

runs-on: ubuntu-latest → The job runs inside a fresh Ubuntu virtual machine provided by GitHub.

4. Steps (What It Does)
Steps are executed in order inside the job.

🔹 Step 1: Checkout Code
yaml
- name: Checkout code
  uses: actions/checkout@v3
Downloads your repository into the virtual machine.

Without this, the pipeline wouldn’t have access to your code.

🔹 Step 2: Set Up Python
yaml
- name: Set up Python
  uses: actions/setup-python@v4
  with:
    python-version: '3.9'
Installs Python 3.9 in the VM.

Ensures your app runs with the correct version.

🔹 Step 3: Install Dependencies
yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: |
    pip install flask
    pip install pytest
Installs required packages:

Flask → for your app.

Pytest → for testing.

You could also use a requirements.txt file here.

🔹 Step 4: Run Tests
yaml
- name: Run tests
  run: |
    pytest
Executes your test suite using Pytest.

If tests fail, the pipeline fails — preventing bad code from merging.
